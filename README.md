# Movies-ETL


## Project Overview
Working with multiple datasets from Wikipedia, Kaggle and MovieLens. The objective
was to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate
transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. Part of this project
consists of refactoring code and creating a function that takes in the three
files listed above and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL
database.
